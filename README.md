# LRG/RB Analysis

This project is the backing library and notebook for graphical, regression, event and statistical analysis for
analyzing salinity data in the Lower Rio Grande/Rio Bravo (LRG/RB) as part of UT Austin's PA325 course.

The project contains functions for transforming CSV sources from a binational coalition of agencies (CILA, CONAGUA, TCEQ, EPA, IBWC). Sources include flow rates and salinity levels at gauges south of the Falcon International Reservior until the Gulf of Mexico.

## Setup

This project is managed with [Rye](https://rye.astral.sh/), follow the instructions there to get up and running with all the dependencies.

## Workflows

- All analysis below can be accessed via the Jupyter server with `rye run jupyter notebook` then navigating to `Analysis.ipynb`.
